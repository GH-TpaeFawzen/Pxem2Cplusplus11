`Pxem2C++11' is a portable shell script that compiles a Pxem program into
C++11 program, outputting the program into standard output.

# Specification of Pxem to be compiled
This tool satisfies original specification of Pxem,
which is described in Japanese:

* Original (dead page)
  * <<http://cfs.maxn.jp/neta/pxem.php>> -- original but dead page
* An archive of the page above
  * <<http://web.archive.org/web/20120605223423/http://cfs.maxn.jp/neta/pxem.php>>

Therefore, these are satisfied:

* incompleteness of `.r`
* incompleteness of `.t`

This tool does never check out if your Pxem program is syntaxically correct;
does never checks if each `.[wxyz]` command and `.a` matches correctly.
If your program were syntaxically incorrect,
the invalid C++11 program will be output.

# Requirements
* POSIX-compliant shell (Bourne shell)
* Some POSIX-compliant tools to compile into C++11:
  * cat, od, tr, sed, basename, printf, grep.
* C++11-compliant compiler to compile generated C++11 program
