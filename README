# Final update (2020-09-01)
This project has been abandoned because of very difficulties of debugging.
Therefore, I'd like to publish everything here in CC0 license.
If you'd like to redevelop this, go ahead.

`Pxem2C++11' is a shell script that compiles a Pxem program into C++11 program.
The script is designed to be as portable as possible.
This tool satisfies original specification of Pxem:

* incompleteness of `.r' and `.t': 

which is described in Japanese:

<<http://cfs.maxn.jp/neta/pxem.php>> -- original but dead page
<<http://web.archive.org/web/20120605223423/http://cfs.maxn.jp/neta/pxem.php>>
  -- an archive of the page above

This tool does never check out if your Pxem program is syntaxically correct;
does never checks if `.[wxyz]' commands and `.a' are nested correctly.
If your program were syntaxically incorrect,
the invalid C++11 program will be output.
